The final project has been devided into 3 section:

1) The test of the vision part is contained in the folder called testVision
2) The test of the robotics part is contained in the folder called testRobotics
3) The plugin for the combined test is contained in the folder called pluginFinalProject
4) The WorkCell provided with the project

A ReadMe file is contained in each of folder describing how to compile and run the tests.

It should be noted that absolute paths are used in this project. Therefore it is strongly adviced that this folder is placed in /home/student/Desktop/workspace/ on a simular version of linux as the ones provided in the RoVI course. If this is not the case, then serveral files will have to be changed accordingly to pass and load specific images and files.
